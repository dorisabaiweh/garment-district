      <span class="firstLetter">A</span><span>s more and more fashion business leave Garment District, the energy that once exuded from the fashion neighborhood has noticeably dwindled. No longer does one see the chaos of huge shipments of garments being shipped, or rows and rows of rolling racks assembled outside a building.</span>
    </p>

      <p>Angela Kim, owner of The Factory 212 has been at the Garment District for 20 years. She remembers what the it was like when she first moved here “it made you want to just work and do things, and design, and cut, and make patterns, and be creative and just make things.” She says now, “you see people closing up, you see less people on the street, you feel less energy, and it’s not that busy.”</p>

      <p>Up until recently, New York’s Garment District has been one of the few neighborhoods in the city that has retained its identity and infrastructure. Unfortunately, what was once a vital home for garment production companies, printmaking business, fabric stores, and other garment trade businesses has been losing its identity for the last twelve years.</p>

      <p>How is this happing? “Rent has gone up and people have gone away” says Lawanda Davis. Lawanda is an employee at Jenny Couture, a garment business on 38th street that focuses on custom wear and alterations. Large amount of textile business in the Garment District have been replaced with hotels, residential housing, and advertising, tech, and media companies.  Jenny McFarlane, the owner of Jenny Couture has been in the Garment District for over twenty years. She says, “the whole Garment District almost has a new face, there are so many more hotels.”  For property owners in the neighborhood, preserving fashion businesses does not benefit them as much as selling their properties to hotels.

        <p>“[Hotels and manufacturing companies] are at two different levels of the economic ladder—landlords don’t give two shits about factories. With landlords, it’s about money, and they get more money by having hotels as their tenants” says Joann Kim, the manager of Johnny’s Fashion Studio—a production studio that creates samples and small lot productions. Over a year ago, the production business had to move from their original West 38th street location to W 35th Street because the landlord increased their rent. </p>

        <p>Aside from an increase in rent, manufacturers are going out of business because brands are cutting the cost of production by going overseas to find cheaper labor. “You want to see the Garment District stay the Garment District and a lot of these companies are going overseas,” says Jenny of Jenny Couture. In the 1990s Johnny’s Fashion Studio was one of the manufacturing companies that produced for Anne Taylor, but the company moved to China, forcing Johnny’s into bankruptcy.</p>

        <p>When these businesses get displaced, so does the Made in America name. “A lot of made in America [clothing] that used to come from this area is not as much as it used to be” says Lawanda, at Jenny Couture. According to the Bloomberg Business, in 1960 95% of clothing sold in the U.S. was manufactured in the Garment District. Today, that number has decreased to approximately 3%. </p>


        <p>This displacement of businesses impacts the landscape of the fashion industry. Historically,  the Garment District is at the core of the startups of major businesses and brands in the United States. Ralph Lauren’s beginning was rooted in the Garment Center.  In 1969, a young Ralph Lauren approached Norman Hilton—a men’s wear manufacturer that was located in the Garment District—about producing a full line of men’s attire under the Polo label. Forty-seven years later, the Ralph Lauren brand is not only a name ingrained in the fashion industry, it is a global multi-billion dollar enterprise. </p>

        <p>That is how big are brands are developed says Angela Kim of The Factory 212; “It starts with a designer who needs a small production of something, then once his/her garments have been produced, they show their collection to a store and if they get a good response, the designer goes back to the manufacturer and ask for more units to be made. If the Garment District wasn’t here, Ralph Lauren would never have happened…Theory would never have happened.”</p>

        <p>Despite its diminishing presence, the Garment District remains an economic boon. The fashion industry is responsible for five percent of all New York city jobs. According to madeinmanhattan.org, nine top fashion companies are headquartered in the Garment District and generate a combined revenue of 31 billion dollars annually. According to New York City’s Economic Development Corporation(NYCEDC), fashion workers in New York earned more than $11 billion in wages in 2013, and contributed close to $1.35 billion to the City’s tax base—those, those numbers include wholesalers, management, and retailers spread throughout the city. Garment District factories alone employ 7,100 New Yorkers that contribute an estimated $2 billion annually to the city’s economy. Twenty eight percent of New York City’s manufacturing jobs are from the apparel industry.</p>

        <p>The future designers that emerge from New York fashion schools such as Parsons, Pratt, and often look to the Garment District for work in the Garment District while they are in school or even after they graduate. Angela Kim’s assistant, Leslie—is an undergrad at Parsons The New School for Design. She says that she often uses the skills she has acquired from working at The Factory 212 and that has only enhanced her educational career in fashion school. Angela Kim states that of the district’s most valuable asset is what the manufacturing employees can teach the upcoming generation of creators. “Manufacturing veterans have their years of experience and that knowledge isn’t really getting passed down to future generations learning how to make [clothes]“ says Kim.</p>

        <p>The district is not only an epicenter of knowledge and skills it is also serves as an essential manufacturing base for young designers to utilize. If an up and coming designer wanted to launch their career by producing a small line, the Garment Center would be the place to make that happen.</p>

        <p>Creating garments is a team effort says Lawanda. “It’s easier for clients to be able to go down [the street] and pick to fabric or for us to go down to the market with them to get the fabrics, pick the color, and all that stuff”. It is about network. If a production company is making samples for a designer, both the designer and production company usually work with a printmaking business across the street and the fabric next door as well as the sample maker down the block or the trimming company two blocks over. This interaction is the essence of the Garment District. However, as more businesses are being driven out due to high rent prices, this system based on proximity is threatened.</p>

        <p>As rent prices go up and brands move their businesses overseas, Joann Kim predicts it wont be too long until the Garment District moves to a different borough. “Nothing can stay the same forever. Inevitably, the Garment Center is no longer going to be in the center of midtown Manhattan.”</p>
